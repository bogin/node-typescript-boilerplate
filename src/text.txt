To stream videos to Facebook Live via RTMP using Node.js, you can follow these steps. In this example, I'll provide a basic implementation for streaming two videos sequentially, each for 1 minute, to a Facebook Live RTMP endpoint.

1. Make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system and accessible in the PATH.
2. Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install child_process @types/node
```

3. Create a TypeScript file (e.g., `facebookLiveStream.ts`):

```
Replace `'video1.mp4'`, `'video2.mp4'`, and `'your_stream_key_here'` with your actual video file paths and Facebook Live stream key.

Please note that this is a basic example, and there might be additional FFmpeg options or error handling that you'd want to add for a production-level application. Also, make sure you have the necessary rights and permissions to stream to Facebook Live using the provided stream key.

Always exercise caution when working with external commands like FFmpeg and handle errors and edge cases appropriately in a real-world application.
